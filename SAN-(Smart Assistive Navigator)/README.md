## Project Overview
* SAN is A wearable assistive navigation system designed to help visually impaired users detect obstacles and unsafe walking surfaces using real-time ultrasonic sensing.*

Instead of relying on a single warning mechanism, the system communicates danger through **vibration**, **audio alerts**, and a **16×2 LCD**, allowing users to receive immediate feedback depending on the surrounding environment.

The project was developed to explore how embedded systems and simple sensors can be combined to solve real-world accessibility problems.

# Problem Statement

Millions of visually impaired individuals rely on traditional white canes for navigation.

While effective for nearby obstacles, they often provide limited awareness of:

- obstacles at head level
- objects farther ahead
- sudden drops
- stairs
- potholes

This project explores a low-cost embedded solution capable of providing earlier warnings through intelligent sensing.

## Software Design

The firmware is divided into independent modules to keep the code organized and easier to maintain.

* Sensor acquisition
* Distance filtering
* Navigation state machine
* LCD display manager
* Alert controller
* Boot diagnostics
* Serial debugging

This modular structure made testing and debugging significantly easier during development.


## Engineering Challenges

During development several practical challenges had to be solved:

- Filtering noisy ultrasonic sensor readings
- Preventing false stair detection
- Stabilizing state transitions using hysteresis
- Handling temporary sensor failures
- Designing distinct vibration and buzzer patterns
- Organizing firmware into modular components for easier debugging


## Safety Features

* Sensor failure handling
* Invalid reading rejection
* Cached sensor recovery
* Hysteresis for stable state transitions
* Startup hardware self-test
* Real-time status display

## Future Improvements

Although the current prototype demonstrates the core navigation system, future versions could include:

- Rechargeable battery management

- Waterproof housing

- Voice feedback

- Bluetooth diagnostics

- Lightweight wearable PCB


## What I Learned

Building this project taught me much more than simply connecting sensors to an Arduino.

Throughout development I learned about:

* Embedded system design
* Sensor calibration
* Finite State Machines (FSM)
* Real-time decision making
* Firmware organization
* Hardware debugging
* Designing reliable user feedback systems

Perhaps the biggest lesson was that making a system *reliable* is often more difficult than making it simply *work*.
